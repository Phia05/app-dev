### Quotes

> "You need to be with people who accpet for whoyouare and they're out there. You should never apologieze for being you." -
Monica Gallagher

### Why this line Thrills me

This line thrills me because it applies in our real life situation. We should choose people who can accept from who we really are like we don't have to pretend just to like us. If who we are this is who we are, we don't have to please them to choose us.
